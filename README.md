## **Features**  
- 🕵️ **Tor-Only** – Built for **Whonix & Tails**, ensuring privacy by default.  
- 🔒 **No KYC, No Logs** – No tracking, no data collection, no compromises.  
- ⚡ **Monero-Centric** – Anonymous, censorship-resistant swaps.  
- 📊 **Real-Time Exchange Rates** – Fetch up-to-date swap pricing.  
- 🛡️ **Multiple `.onion` Addresses** – Enhances security by rotating access points.

## **How It Works**  
1. **Fetch Exchange Rates** – Retrieve real-time rates for available swap pairs.  
2. **Initiate a Swap** – Enter details and create a swap **privately**.  
3. **Send Payment** – Transfer the required Monero (XMR) to complete the swap.  
4. **Monitor Swap Status** – Check the progress of your transaction.  
5. **View Swap History** – Securely access past transactions.  
6. **Delete Swap History** – Option to wipe all saved swaps with confirmation.  

---

## **Security & Privacy**  
- **Tor-Only** – Operates exclusively through `.onion` services for privacy.  
- **No JavaScript** – Fully functional in a minimal, secure environment.  
- **Anonymous Transactions** – No user data is collected or stored.  
- **Privacy-Friendly CAPTCHA** – Prevents automated abuse while preserving anonymity.  

---

## **Error Handling & Improvements**  
- If an error occurs, **XMRGlobal.py** will **return to the main menu** instead of exiting.  
- When a swap is in a **waiting state**, it will **display full deposit details** instead of incorrectly marking the amount as "sent."  
- **Swap History Management** – Users can **delete all saved swap records** with a simple confirmation prompt (`yes/no`).
